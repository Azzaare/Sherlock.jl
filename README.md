# Sherlock.jl


### Not Ready for Public Use

### Overview
The goal for Sherlock is to make it easy to make design document charts, and interrogate packages from a "high level" either visually or programmatically (from the REPL, or whatever). The current state of the code is somewhere between "hot mess" and "early sunday morning hacking away". So, feel free to contribute, or clean things up, or whatever you want.

This was started because someone wanted some design document things from another project. So, rather then go through that drudgery it seemed most appropriate to make a tool that let's people do this for everyone - easily. 

Right now there's very little functionality but - look a pretty picture!
